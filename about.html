My name is Kai Meerbott, I am a second year student here at The University of Rhode Island. I am currently 19 years old and I have recently became a Computer Science major.
Some of my hobbies are listening to music, playing sports, and spending time with friends. My favorite sports are football and basketball and I am a big time Patriots, Celtics, Redsox, and Bruins fan.
